# Gensyn

## What it does

Gensyn is a protocol for decentralized ML compute: clients submit training
jobs, untrusted third-party providers execute them, and a verification layer
lets the client trust the result without controlling or re-running all of the
provider's hardware.

## Architecture summary

Current production system is **Verde** (per Gensyn's own research blog,
Oct 2026 check), which replaced the older litepaper-era design built around
four roles (Submitters, Solvers, Verifiers, Whistleblowers) and a Truebit-style
challenge game. Verde combines two pieces:

- **RepOps (Reproducible Operators)**: forces a fixed operation ordering for
  ML operators so that execution is bitwise-reproducible across different
  hardware, closing the floating-point non-associativity gap that previously
  made exact-match verification unreliable across GPUs/vendors.
- **Two-level bisection game**: providers commit to each training iteration
  via Merkle trees; disputes are resolved by bisecting first at the iteration
  level, then the operation level, so a referee only has to re-check a small,
  pinpointed slice of the computation instead of re-running the whole job.

(Gensyn's own research blog).

Note: the older litepaper (docs.gensyn.ai/litepaper) describes a different,
earlier design — a Truebit-style incentive game with Submitter/Solver/
Verifier/Whistleblower roles and a graph-based "pinpoint protocol." That
litepaper is confirmed by Gensyn's own ecosystem write-ups to be **outdated**
relative to Verde. Documented here for lineage, not as current architecture.

## Built on (foundational lineage)

See [foundations/decentralized-training.md](../foundations/decentralized-training.md)
for the primary seed paper (Proof-of-Learning). Verde's own research post
additionally cites, as directly relevant prior work:

- **Refereed Delegation of Computation** — [dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2046707.2046759](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2046707.2046759)
  — the referee/dispute-arbitration pattern Verde's bisection game descends from.
- **Agatha** — [arxiv.org/abs/2105.04919](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04919) — prior
  execution-verification approach Verde explicitly improves on.
- **Toploc** — [arxiv.org/abs/2501.16007](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16007) — another
  prior approach Verde positions itself against (couldn't extend to training,
  per Gensyn's own description).
- **Proof-of-Training-Data** — [arxiv.org/abs/2307.00682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00682)
- Verde's own full research paper: [arxiv.org/abs/2502.19405](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19405)

## Property matrix

| Property | Current value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Verification mechanism | RepOps (bitwise-reproducible ops) + two-level bisection/dispute game | Verde research post |
| Trust model | Optimistic — provider's result accepted unless a referee is triggered to arbitrate a disputed step | Verde research post |
| Re-execution cost on dispute | Only the pinpointed iteration/operation, not the full job | Verde research post |
| Legacy design (superseded) | Truebit-style 4-role game (Submitter/Solver/Verifier/Whistleblower) | docs.gensyn.ai/litepaper (confirmed outdated) |
| Maturity | Verde described as "in production" by Gensyn as of this research post | Verde research post title |

## Known limitations

- The litepaper's incentive-game numbers (staking, slashing, jackpot rewards)
  are from the superseded design; current economic parameters for Verde were
  not found in this pass and should be checked directly against Gensyn's
  current docs before citing specifics.
- RepOps's bitwise-reproducibility claim depends on providers running the
  mandated fixed operation ordering; no independent third-party audit of this
  claim was located in this pass — flagged as a candidate for a future watch
  run if an independent analysis is published.
