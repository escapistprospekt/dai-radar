## What it does

Allora is a decentralized network (a "Model Coordination Network") where
many independent ML models submit predictions/inferences on a given
topic; the network combines them into a single synthesized inference
that is intended to outperform any single contributing model, and pays
contributors based on the measured quality of their individual
contribution to that combined result.

## Architecture summary

- Built on the **Cosmos SDK**, using **CometBFT** as the underlying BFT
  consensus engine, with a **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)** validator
  set securing the chain itself (this part is standard Cosmos-chain
  infrastructure, not Allora-specific).
- Allora-specific layer on top: **Workers** submit inferences/forecasts
  on a "topic"; **Reputers** stake-weight and score those submissions
  for accuracy; the network combines scored submissions into a single
  output via Allora's own **"Inference Synthesis"** mechanism.
- Rewards are distributed based on each participant's measured marginal
  contribution to the synthesized result, not raw output volume — intended
  to reward genuinely useful predictions over ones that just add noise.
- Mainnet (with the ALLO token) launched 2025-11-11, per Allora
  Foundation's own announcement
  ([allora.network/blog/allora-foundation-announces-launch-of-allora-mainnet-and-allo-token](https://www.allora.network/blog/allora-foundation-announces-launch-of-allora-mainnet-and-allo-token)).
  ALLO launched across multiple chains (Ethereum, Base, BNB Chain) in
  addition to Allora's own L1.

## Built on (foundational lineage)

**No external academic lineage was found, despite checking.** This is
worth stating plainly rather than forcing a fit:

- Allora's technical design is documented in its own self-published
  paper, *"Allora: a Self-Improving, Decentralized Machine Intelligence
  Network"* (Kruijssen, Emmons, Peluso, Ghaffar, Huang, Longmore, Kell —
  2024), published in "Allora Decentralized Intelligence," which is
  Allora's own research venue, not a third-party peer-reviewed journal.
  PDF: [research.assets.allora.network/allora.0x10001.pdf](https://research.assets.allora.network/allora.0x10001.pdf).
- Direct inspection of that PDF found **no citations to prior external
  academic work** grounding the "Inference Synthesis" mechanism, the
  Reputer scoring/reward design, or the stake-weighted consensus layer
  (the base-chain BFT/DPoS machinery is standard Cosmos tooling, not
  something Allora invented or needs to cite).
- A 2025 follow-on preprint by overlapping authors, *"Context-Aware
  Inference via Performance Forecasting in Decentralized Learning
  Networks"* (Pfeffer, Kruijssen, et al., [arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06444](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06444)),
  extends the same in-house framework rather than introducing external
  grounding.
- Checked `docs.allora.network/learn/what-is-allora` as well — it
  points back to the same self-published whitepaper, no external
  citation trail there either.

Net: unlike EZKL (PLONK via Halo2) or Gensyn (explicit citations to
Proof-of-Learning, Agatha, etc.), Allora's core mechanism reads as an
original in-house construction, not an implementation of prior academic
work. **No `foundations/` file was created for this entry** — creating
one would misrepresent a self-published whitepaper as an external
foundational seed paper in the same sense as the other tracked systems'
entries. This should be revisited if Allora's team publishes something
that does engage with prior ensemble-learning/mechanism-design
literature (e.g. classic stacked-generalization or prediction-market
scoring-rule work), which "Inference Synthesis" and the Reputer reward
design resemble in spirit but do not cite directly.

## Property matrix

| Property | Current value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Base chain | Cosmos SDK + CometBFT, DPoS validator set | Allora whitepaper/docs, grounded |
| Core mechanism | Inference Synthesis — combines Worker submissions into one output, scored/weighted by Reputers | Allora whitepaper, grounded |
| Incentive design | Rewards based on measured marginal contribution to the synthesized result | Allora whitepaper, grounded |
| Token / cross-chain | ALLO token; mainnet + multichain (Ethereum, Base, BNB Chain) launch 2025-11-11 | Allora Foundation announcement, grounded |
| Academic grounding | None found externally; architecture is self-published, not derived from cited prior work | Direct PDF inspection + docs site check, grounded (as a negative finding) |

## Known limitations

- No independent third-party audit of the Inference Synthesis or Reputer
  scoring mechanism was located in this pass.
- Because the core mechanism isn't grounded in external literature, there's
  no independent theoretical analysis to cross-check its claimed properties
  (e.g. collusion-resistance of the Reputer scoring) against — it has to be
  evaluated on the Allora team's own self-published analysis alone.
- Current economic/staking parameters (minimum stakes, slashing conditions)
  were not verified in this pass and should be checked against current
  docs.allora.network before citing specifics.
