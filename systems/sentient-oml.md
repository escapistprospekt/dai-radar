## What it does

Sentient is a protocol for publishing open-weight AI models while still giving
the model's owners/contributors enforceable ownership, usage tracking, and a
revenue stream — addressing the problem that a fully open model can normally
be copied and monetized by anyone, with no way to trace or compensate the
original builder.

## Architecture summary

- Built around the **OML (Open, Monetizable, Loyal)** framework: a model
  should be inspectable/open (**Open**), trigger compensation to its owners
  on every call (**Monetizable**), and have misuse/unauthorized use be
  detectable (**Loyal**).
- Four-layer protocol stack: **storage** (immutable/available hosting of the
  model artifact), **distribution** (converting the artifact into OML format),
  **access** (authorizing/tracking each query), **incentive** (routing
  collected fees to builders). (Source: openagi.discourse.group summary of
  the Sentient protocol design, cross-confirmed by multiple secondary
  write-ups — not fetched from a single Sentient primary doc in this pass.)
- Production mechanism is reported as the **"Melange" method** — combining
  model fingerprinting, TEE (trusted execution environment) execution, and
  on-chain contract-based revenue distribution. This is a secondary-source
  characterization (search aggregation), not independently confirmed against
  a primary Sentient doc in this pass — flagged as inferred.
- Chain architecture: designed to be **L1-agnostic / EVM-compatible** rather
  than requiring its own base chain (reported compatible with Ethereum and
  other L1s); no dedicated standalone "Sentient Chain" was found. Sentient's
  own network is referred to as **GRID**.

## Built on (foundational lineage)

**Paper:** "OML: Open, Monetizable, and Loyal AI" — Cheng, Contente, Finch,
Golev, Hayase, Miller, Moshrefi, Nasery, Nailwal, Oh, Tyagi, Viswanath.
IACR ePrint 2024/1573 (received 2024-10-05).

**Grounding:** this is about as direct as grounding gets — 5 of the 12 listed
authors (Contente, Finch, Golev, Nailwal, Tyagi) are affiliated with
**Sentient Foundation** itself, alongside academic co-authors from Princeton,
University of Washington, and UIUC. This paper is not third-party prior work
Sentient cites — it is Sentient's own team publishing the protocol's
founding paper. The paper introduces "AI-native cryptography" as its core
contribution: cryptographic techniques designed around the continuous,
low-dimensional-manifold structure of AI model representations, rather than
the binary correct/incorrect security model of traditional cryptography.
Model fingerprinting (OML 1.0) is presented as the first primitive built in
this new framework.

This lineage is **distinct** from every other foundations/ entry in this
repo (PLONK/ZKML, Proof-of-Learning/decentralized-training, TFHE/FHE-ML,
LSSS-Curl/MPC-ML, Shapley/decentralized-consensus) — see
`foundations/ai-native-cryptography.md`.

## Property matrix

| Property | Current value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Core mechanism | Model fingerprinting (OML 1.0) embedded via fine-tuning | eprint 2024/1573, grounded |
| Theoretical basis | "AI-native cryptography" — exploits continuous/low-dimensional structure of AI representations rather than binary security guarantees | eprint 2024/1573, grounded |
| Protocol layers | Storage, distribution, access, incentive (4-layer stack) | openagi.discourse.group summary, secondary-sourced |
| Production trust mechanism | Reported to combine fingerprinting + TEE execution + on-chain revenue splitting ("Melange" method) | secondary-source aggregation, inferred — not confirmed against a Sentient primary doc this pass |
| Ownership distribution | NFT-based ownership mint used for the Dobby model (reported 650,000-participant mint) | Cointelegraph / Investing.com news coverage, not a primary Sentient doc |
| Base chain | L1-agnostic / EVM-compatible; no dedicated standalone chain found; native network referred to as "GRID" | search aggregation, inferred |
| Released models | Dobby / Dobby Plus (Llama fine-tunes, uncensored-tuned), published on HuggingFace | secondary coverage |
| Maturity | GRID mainnet **not live** as of the most recent coverage found (planned Q2 2026, no committed date confirmed as of Aug 2026); core utility (staking, fee distribution) is gated on this launch | news aggregation, inferred |

## Comparison axes

| Axis | Class | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Correctness | NOT COVERED | OML targets ownership: fingerprints detect unauthorized use of a model, not whether an output was computed correctly | Not addressed in this file's sources |
| Trust rests on | OPEN QUESTION | Production mechanism reportedly combines fingerprinting, TEE execution and on-chain revenue splits; unconfirmed | Secondary-source aggregation, inferred |
| Confidentiality | NOT COVERED | Models are open-weight by design ("Open") | Not addressed in this file's sources |
| Lineage | OWN PAPER | OML paper (ePrint 2024/1573); 5 of 12 authors at Sentient Foundation | eprint 2024/1573, grounded |
| Maturity | PRE-LAUNCH | GRID mainnet not live; no committed date as of Aug 2026; models released on HuggingFace | News aggregation, inferred |
| On-chain | EXISTING CHAINS | L1-agnostic and EVM-compatible; no dedicated chain found | Search aggregation, inferred |

## Known limitations

- The core cryptographic/ML contribution (model fingerprinting via
  "AI-native cryptography") is grounded directly in Sentient's own
  peer-authored paper — strong grounding. The *production* mechanism
  (TEE + on-chain revenue split, the "Melange" method) was not verified
  against a primary Sentient source in this pass and should be rechecked.
- Core on-chain utility — staking, fee distribution, task qualification —
  is reported as gated on the GRID mainnet launch, which had no committed
  date as of the most recent coverage found. Treat any claims about live
  revenue-sharing or staking mechanics as aspirational/not-yet-operational
  until the mainnet status is reconfirmed.
- Ownership-via-NFT-mint (the Dobby distribution model) is a reported
  mechanism from news coverage, not verified against Sentient's own
  documentation of the mint's actual mechanics in this pass.
