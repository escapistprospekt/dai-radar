# Prime Intellect

## What it does

Prime Intellect runs a GPU compute marketplace (50+ data centers, single-GPU
to multi-thousand-GPU clusters) and an open decentralized training stack on
top of it. Its best-known result is INTELLECT-1, the first openly
decentralized-trained 10B-parameter language model, trained across five
countries and three continents on up to 112 H100s running concurrently.

## Architecture summary

- **PRIME framework**: a fault-tolerant distributed training framework for
  unreliable, globally distributed nodes. Core piece is the
  **ElasticDeviceMesh**, which manages a dynamic global process group for
  fault-tolerant internet communication plus local process groups for
  intra-node communication, with live checkpoint recovery.
- PRIME combines **FSDP2** (intra-node sharded data parallelism) with
  **DiLoCo** (inter-node low-communication optimization) in a hybrid
  setup, plus a custom int8 all-reduce, to get a reported ~400x reduction
  in cross-node communication bandwidth versus standard data-parallel
  training.
- In the INTELLECT-1 run, nodes trained independently for ~38 minutes
  between synchronization steps, each sync taking ~1-7 minutes; reported
  compute utilization was 83% across continents and 96% when restricted to
  US-only nodes.
- Separately, Prime Intellect operates a "PI protocol" layer described as
  providing on-chain primitives for trust, collaboration, and collective
  ownership of resulting models by compute/data/code contributors — this
  layer is comparatively thin on technical documentation in what's
  publicly available; treat specifics as inferred, not grounded.

## Built on (foundational lineage)

**Paper:** "DiLoCo: Distributed Low-Communication Training of Language
Models" — Arthur Douillard, Qixuan Feng, Andrei A. Rusu, Rachita
Chhaparia, Yani Donchev, Adhiguna Kuncoro, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Arthur
Szlam, Jiajun Shen (Google DeepMind). arXiv:2311.08105 (Nov 2023).

**Grounding source:** Prime Intellect's own OpenDiLoCo announcement states
directly: *"Introducing OpenDiLoCo, an open-source implementation and
scaling of DeepMind's Distributed Low-Communication (DiLoCo) method,
enabling globally distributed AI model training,"* and separately
describes OpenDiLoCo as *"a reproducible implementation of DeepMind's
DiLoCo experiments."*
([primeintellect.ai/blog/opendiloco](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/opendiloco))
This is direct, explicit grounding — not a multi-hop inference.

**How it's used:** DiLoCo's core idea — an inner optimizer (AdamW) doing
many local steps per worker, with an outer optimizer (Nesterov-momentum
SGD) periodically synchronizing pseudo-gradients across workers — is what
lets PRIME's workers train independently for tens of minutes between
syncs. Prime Intellect's own OpenDiLoCo paper (arXiv:2407.07852) extended
this to real multi-continent runs; the INTELLECT-1 technical report
(arXiv:2412.01152) layers FSDP2 and the ElasticDeviceMesh on top of that
same DiLoCo core for the 10B-parameter run.

This is a **distinct lineage** from `foundations/decentralized-training.md`
(Proof-of-Learning, cited by Gensyn): that paper addresses verifying that
training happened as claimed; DiLoCo addresses how to train efficiently
across poorly-connected nodes in the first place. Same field, different
problem, different seed paper — kept as a separate foundations file per
the repo's one-file-per-lineage rule.

## Property matrix

| Property | Current value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Core training algorithm | DiLoCo (local SGD: AdamW inner optimizer + Nesterov-momentum outer optimizer) | DiLoCo paper (arXiv:2311.08105), grounded |
| Framework | PRIME (ElasticDeviceMesh + hybrid FSDP2/DiLoCo + int8 all-reduce) | INTELLECT-1 technical report (arXiv:2412.01152), grounded |
| Communication reduction | ~400x vs. standard data-parallel (PRIME); DiLoCo alone reports ~500x in DeepMind's original benchmarks | OpenDiLoCo blog + DiLoCo paper, grounded |
| Largest public run | INTELLECT-1: 10B params, 1T tokens, up to 112 H100s, 5 countries/3 continents | primeintellect.ai/blog/intellect-1, grounded |
| Compute utilization (INTELLECT-1) | 83% cross-continent, 96% US-only nodes | INTELLECT-1 technical report, grounded |
| Trust/incentive layer | "PI protocol" — described as providing on-chain trust primitives and collective model ownership for contributors | General sourcing (third-party coverage), **inferred** — primary-source technical detail not found in this pass |
| Maturity | Production research lab with a live GPU marketplace; INTELLECT-1 is a completed, published run, not a running mainnet protocol in the Gensyn/Bittensor sense | Inferred from available sourcing |

## Known limitations

- The DiLoCo/PRIME technical lineage is solidly grounded; the crypto/
  protocol trust-and-ownership layer is not — this entry did not find
  primary documentation (whitepaper-grade) specifying how compute
  contributors are verified or how ownership stakes are actually computed
  and enforced. Flagged as an open follow-up, not resolved here.
- INTELLECT-1's distributed run involved known, coordinating participants
  rather than fully open/untrusted compute contribution — unlike Gensyn's
  design, there is no visible adversarial-verification mechanism (fraud
  proofs, bisection games) in the training framework itself. Worth
  rechecking if Prime Intellect's protocol layer matures to include one.
- Figures above (utilization %, bandwidth reduction) are self-reported by
  Prime Intellect in their own technical report; no independent
  third-party reproduction of the INTELLECT-1 run's numbers was located in
  this pass.
