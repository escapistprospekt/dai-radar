## What it does

Private Cloud Compute (PCC) lets Apple Intelligence offload AI requests that
need more capability than an on-device model can provide, to Apple's own
servers, while keeping the same privacy guarantee as on-device processing.
Per Apple's own description: "Personal user data sent to PCC isn't accessible
to anyone other than the user — not even to Apple."
([security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute](https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/))

## Architecture summary

- **Hardware root of trust**: custom-built Apple silicon server hardware
  carrying the same Secure Enclave and Secure Boot technology used in
  iPhone/iPad. Certificates are rooted in each node's Secure Enclave UID.
- **Attestation**: before a device sends encrypted request data, it
  cryptographically verifies the target PCC node's attestation. Requests
  bypass load balancers and encrypt directly to the validated node.
- **Physical/manufacturing verification**: high-resolution imaging and
  tamper switches activated before sealing; data-center validation involves
  multiple independent Apple teams plus third-party observation.
- **Multi-vendor attestation**: for components whose compromise could
  exfiltrate data, attestation is rooted in at least two independent
  hardware vendors (Apple's own hardware plus, for some components, Google
  Cloud) rather than a single vendor's root of trust.
- **Stateless / no-retention design**: the Secure Enclave randomizes the
  data-volume encryption key on every reboot without persisting it;
  request-associated data is deleted on completion; address space is
  periodically recycled; there is no remote shell or interactive debugging
  interface into production nodes.
- **Public verifiability**: every production PCC software build's
  measurement is written to an append-only, cryptographically tamper-proof
  transparency log; binary images are published for independent inspection
  within 90 days; a Virtual Research Environment and source releases
  (the CloudAttestation and Thimble projects) let outside researchers
  verify the published software matches what's actually running.
- **Request anonymization (separate from the confidentiality claim above)**:
  RSA Blind Signatures (IETF RFC 9474) and an Oblivious HTTP relay (RFC 9458)
  are used so that request routing can't be linked back to a specific
  device/identity — this is about non-targetability, not about protecting
  the content of the request itself.

## Built on (foundational lineage)

**No academic paper is cited for the core confidentiality/attestation
design.** Checked Apple's own PCC security blog posts directly — the only
explicit external references are two IETF RFCs used for a narrower piece
of the system (request anonymization, not confidentiality of compute):

- **RSA Blind Signatures** — [RFC 9474](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9474)
- **Oblivious HTTP** — [RFC 9458](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9458)

The actual confidentiality/attestation mechanism (Secure Enclave, Secure
Boot, hardware-rooted certificates) is grounded entirely in Apple's own
prior engineering, documented in the **Apple Platform Security Guide**
([help.apple.com/pdf/security](https://help.apple.com/pdf/security/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf)),
not in an externally authored, independently reviewed paper. This is the
same kind of grounding gap flagged in this repo's Bittensor entry — stated
plainly rather than forced into a citation that isn't actually there.
No new `foundations/` file was created for this reason; there's no distinct
academic lineage to seed one with.

Independent *analysis* of PCC exists in the academic literature — e.g.
"Unlocking Apple's Private Cloud Compute: An Analysis of Privacy-Preserving
Artificial Intelligence" ([arXiv:2605.24239](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.24239)) —
but that's third-party research examining PCC from the outside, not
something PCC's own design cites as foundational.

## Known limitations

- **Fundamentally different trust model from the other tracked systems in
  this repo.** ZKML/FHE/MPC systems here derive their guarantees from
  cryptographic hardness assumptions, independent of any single hardware
  vendor. PCC's guarantee ultimately rests on hardware correctness and
  Apple's own manufacturing/physical-security process — a trust model that
  shouldn't be read as equivalent in kind just because it's also labeled
  "confidential computing." Worth keeping distinct in any cross-system
  comparison.
- No external academic paper grounds the core attestation design (see
  above) — this entry's grounding is strong on primary-source documentation
  but weak on independent academic lineage, by the nature of what PCC
  actually is.
- Independent security critiques of PCC beyond the one analysis paper
  found above were not surveyed in this pass — a candidate for a future
  watch-run if third-party security research on PCC accumulates.
