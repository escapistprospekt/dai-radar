## What it does

Spectral Labs builds "Spectral Syntax," a platform for creating, deploying,
and monetizing autonomous on-chain agents (the "Onchain Agent Economy") —
agents that interact with DeFi/blockchain systems from natural-language
prompts rather than hand-written smart-contract code. Related products
include an agent launchpad for autonomous trading (on Hyperliquid) and
"Grid AI," described as a spot market for ML inference.

## Architecture summary

- A "coordinator" component manages agent communication, wallet handling,
  and plugin integration — every stage from prompt submission to on-chain
  agent action runs through it. (Source: general sourcing via third-party
  explainer coverage, not independently confirmed against primary docs —
  see confidence note below.)
- **Historical technical core (2023-era): zkML.** Spectral's own account
  posted directly: *"We've been working with @jasonmorton, @CamutoDante
  and @henlojseam at @ezklxyz to implement zkML into our upcoming machine
  learning platform"*
  ([twitter.com/Spectral_Labs/status/1717657586496111034](https://twitter.com/Spectral_Labs/status/1717657586496111034)).
  Those three accounts are EZKL team members — this is Spectral's own
  primary-source statement of a direct collaboration, not an inferred
  connection.
- **Current framing has moved away from that.** Multiple secondary
  sources (crypto-explainer coverage, not Spectral's own primary text)
  report that a more recent version of Spectral's whitepaper shifts
  toward "a decentralized proxy framework with real-time model output
  consumption," explicitly placing *less* emphasis on zkML's role in IP
  protection than earlier material did. I could not independently confirm
  this against the whitepaper's actual text — the public docs site
  (docs.spectrallabs.xyz) redirects to an internal GitBook editor URL,
  not a public reader page, so I couldn't fetch its current content
  directly. Flagging this as reported-but-unverified rather than treating
  it as confirmed.

## Built on (foundational lineage)

Historical grounding runs through a real collaboration, not a citation to
a paper directly: Spectral → (worked with) → EZKL's own team → (EZKL is
built on) → Halo2 → (cites) → PLONK. See
[systems/ezkl.md](ezkl.md) and [foundations/zkml.md](../foundations/zkml.md)
for that downstream lineage; the EZKL-collaboration claim itself is
grounded in Spectral's own tweet (link above), not inferred.

No new foundations file created — this doesn't need to duplicate
`foundations/zkml.md` since it's the same lineage, reached via a direct
team collaboration rather than Spectral citing the paper itself.

**Open question, not resolved here:** whether Spectral's *current*
product (post zkML-de-emphasis) still uses any of this cryptographic
machinery at all, or whether "zkML" was an earlier pivot that's since
been abandoned in favor of something else entirely. The sourcing
available in this pass couldn't settle that either way.

## Property matrix

| Property | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Original ML-verification approach | zkML, via direct collaboration with EZKL's team | Spectral's own tweet, grounded |
| Current architecture (as reported) | "Decentralized proxy framework, real-time model output consumption" | Secondary/explainer coverage of a whitepaper update — not independently confirmed, **weak** |
| Token | SPEC — governance/utility, staking, planned "Inferchain" protocol | Messari/CoinGecko-type sourcing, general |
| Notable products | Spectral Syntax (agent creation), Grid AI (inference spot market), trading-agent launchpad on Hyperliquid | Third-party coverage (gen.xyz, mementoresearch), general |
| Maturity | Active token/product, but primary technical docs not independently verifiable in this pass | Inferred from access limitations, not from a maturity assessment |

## Known limitations

- **Documentation access**: the public docs URL redirects to an
  internal GitBook editor interface rather than a public-facing reader
  page, so this entry could not verify current technical claims against
  Spectral's own primary documentation. This is a limitation of this
  research pass, not a claim about documentation quality.
- **Narrative drift**: the one solidly-grounded technical claim
  (zkML via EZKL collaboration) appears, per secondary sources, to have
  been de-emphasized in favor of a vaguer framing that I could not pin
  down technically. Worth a second pass if/when primary docs become
  accessible, specifically to answer: does any cryptographic
  verification mechanism currently back this product, or not.
- Most available sourcing is third-party crypto-explainer content
  (CoinGecko, Gate, AiCoin, Messari) rather than primary technical
  material — treat property-matrix rows sourced this way as
  lower-confidence than entries elsewhere in this repo grounded directly
  in a system's own docs.
