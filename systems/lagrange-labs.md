## What it does

DeepProve is Lagrange Labs' zkML system: it generates zero-knowledge
proofs that a specific LLM produced a specific output sequence from a
specific input, without re-running the model or trusting the party that
did. Unlike earlier zkML work limited to single tokens or isolated
components, DeepProve targets full end-to-end LLM inference — it
certifies that the whole output sequence is correct rather than
encoding the entire inference computation in-circuit, which is what
lets it avoid the quadratic circuit blowup or expensive RAM modeling
that sank earlier approaches.

Lagrange Labs is a separate project from, but shares the "ZK
coprocessor" branding with, Lagrange's other product line — a
decentralized ZK Prover Network / ZK Coprocessor for proving SQL
queries over on-chain data, which (per Lagrange's own docs) uses
Plonky2. **DeepProve is not that system** — it's a distinct proving
construction built specifically for ML inference. Don't conflate the
two when reading Lagrange's broader materials.

## Architecture summary

- Core building blocks, per DeepProve's own paper abstract: the
  **sum-check protocol** and **lookup arguments**, used to verify
  individual LLM operators (multi-head attention, layer normalization,
  grouped-query attention, rotary positional embeddings) without
  encoding the full computation as one monolithic circuit.
- Native format support: ONNX, safetensors, and GGUF — so models
  exported from PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, or Hugging Face run through
  DeepProve unchanged (no custom model-authoring step required).
- Positioned explicitly against two named prior systems: **zkGPT**
  (USENIX'25, single-token proofs) and **zkLLM** (CCS'24, proved only
  the Softmax component) — DeepProve's claimed contribution is doing
  both end-to-end and faster.

## Built on (foundational lineage)

**Two-hop grounding**, same pattern as this repo's EZKL entry:

1. DeepProve's own paper — *"DeepProve: Verifiable End-to-End Large
   Language Model Inference"* (IACR ePrint
   [2026/1112](https://eprint.iacr.org/2026/1112), accepted CCS 2026;
   authors include Yupeng Zhang and Charalampos Papamanthou, both
   established authors in prior sum-check-based SNARK literature) —
   explicitly names the **sum-check protocol** as a core building
   block in its own abstract.
2. The sum-check protocol's original paper: Lund, Fortnow, Karloff,
   Nisan, *"Algebraic methods for interactive proof systems,"* Journal
   of the ACM 39(4), 1992. This is the standard, widely-cited origin
   of the technique (confirmed via multiple independent sources,
   including the paper's own author describing it on social media as
   his most-cited work specifically because of its zkSNARK reuse).

**Not confirmed from a direct source in this pass:** whether DeepProve's
paper cites the 1992 paper by name in its bibliography, versus citing
an intermediate sum-check-based SNARK (GKR, Libra, Virgo, Spartan,
HyperPlonk, or Lasso/Jolt, all of which build on the same 1992
technique) — the abstract fetch used for this entry didn't expose the
full reference list. Treat the specific DeepProve→1992-paper link as
the standard lineage for "a sum-check-based proving system," not as a
confirmed direct citation in DeepProve's own bibliography.

See `foundations/zkml-sumcheck.md` — this is a **separate lineage**
from `foundations/zkml.md` (PLONK/Halo2, used by EZKL). Both files
share the field "ZKML / verifiable inference" but root in genuinely
different proving techniques (PLONKish arithmetization vs.
sum-check-based verification), so they're kept as distinct foundation
entries rather than merged.

## Property matrix

| Property | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Proving technique | Sum-check protocol + lookup arguments (not PLONKish arithmetization) | DeepProve paper abstract, grounded |
| Model format support | ONNX, safetensors, GGUF | DeepProve paper abstract / lagrange.dev, grounded |
| Claimed proving speedup | 20–60× faster than prior SOTA (paper abstract framing); a separate press release states "60×faster / 671× faster verification" — the two framings weren't reconciled in this pass, may refer to different baselines/benchmarks | DeepProve paper abstract; Lagrange press release — **flagged discrepancy, not resolved** |
| Example throughput | GPT-2: 174 tokens/min; Gemma 3: 86 tokens/min; verification in 1–3.7 seconds | DeepProve paper abstract, grounded |
| Production track record | 12M+ cryptographic proofs generated, 3M+ AI inferences verified end-to-end, as of the open-source release (June 2026) | Lagrange press release, grounded |
| Trust model (trusted setup or transparent) | Not confirmed from a direct source in this pass — sum-check-based systems are *typically* transparent (no CRS), but DeepProve's specific underlying polynomial commitment scheme wasn't identified here | **Inferred, unverified** — recheck before relying on this |
| Maturity | Open-sourced June 2026; github.com/Lagrange-Labs/deep-prove; live dashboard at deep-prove.lagrange.dev | Lagrange press release / blog, grounded |

## Known limitations

- Throughput (174 tokens/min for GPT-2, a small model by current
  standards) is far below normal plaintext LLM serving throughput —
  the "faster than prior zkML work" framing is a comparison against
  other zero-knowledge approaches, not against unproven inference.
  Worth keeping in mind when judging practicality.
- The proving-speedup framing differs between DeepProve's own paper
  abstract (20–60×) and Lagrange's press release (60× / 671×) — not
  reconciled in this pass; don't cite a single number without checking
  which baseline it refers to.
- Trust model (trusted setup vs. transparent) not independently
  confirmed here — flagged as an open follow-up, same category as
  EZKL's unresolved SRS-size claims elsewhere in this repo.
