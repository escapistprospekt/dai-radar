## What it does

io.net aggregates underutilized GPUs (data centers, crypto miners,
independent providers) across many countries into an on-demand,
clusterable compute marketplace, primarily marketed at AI
training/inference workloads.

## Architecture summary

- **IO-SDK** is io.net's own orchestration layer. Its own docs state
  directly: *"IO-SDK is our specialized fork of Ray, a core technology
  driving io.net's capabilities"* and name the base version as Ray 2.3.0.
  ([io.net/docs/guides/architecture/io-architecture](https://io.net/docs/guides/architecture/io-architecture))
- Backend stack layered on top: Kubernetes/Prefect/Airflow for
  orchestration, Ray/Ludwig/PyTorch/Keras/TensorFlow for execution,
  S3/HDFS for storage, Docker for containerization, Grafana/Datadog/
  Prometheus/NVIDIA DCGM for monitoring (per io.net's own architecture
  docs).
- **Resource-integrity mechanisms** (io.net-specific, not inherited from
  Ray): a "Proof-of-Work" and "Proof of Time-Lock" (PoTL) pair that
  check a provided GPU/CPU is real and stays dedicated to the rented
  workload for its full rental period, plus a daily "Cluster
  Verification Job" standardized benchmark that workers must pass to
  stay in the active pool.
- **Confidential compute**: io.net supports NVIDIA H200-based hardware
  confidential computing, using SPDM 1.1 for device authentication,
  X.509 PKI, OCSP, and TCG measurement/attestation specifications, via
  NVIDIA's own `nv-attestation-sdk`. Recommended mode is "Protected
  PCIe" (PPCIe), which puts an entire NVLink-connected GPU set into
  confidential mode together.

## Built on (foundational lineage)

**Two-hop grounding for the orchestration engine, no grounding found for
the trust/verification layer:**

1. io.net's own docs name **Ray** (specifically IO-SDK as a fork of Ray
   2.3.0) as the technology underlying its clustering/task-orchestration
   capability — direct quote above.
2. Ray is itself an academic systems project: *"Ray: A Distributed
   Framework for Emerging AI Applications"* — P. Moritz, R. Nishihara,
   S. Wang, A. Tumanov, R. Liaw, E. Liang, M. Elibol, Z. Yang, W. Paul,
   M. I. Jordan, I. Stoica (UC Berkeley), OSDI 2018.
   ([usenix.org/system/files/osdi18-moritz.pdf](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi18-moritz.pdf))

See `/foundations/distributed-compute-scheduling.md`.

**Important distinction:** this lineage grounds io.net's *compute
orchestration engine only*. The parts of io.net that are actually about
decentralization/trust — PoW/PoTL resource verification, the Cluster
Verification Job, the confidential-compute attestation chain — are not
shown by io.net's own docs to descend from any specific academic paper.
They're described in terms of industry standards (SPDM, TCG, X.509) and
NVIDIA's own tooling, not a citable research lineage. Flagged as
no-academic-grounding-found rather than inferring one.

## Property matrix

| Property | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration engine | IO-SDK, a fork of Ray 2.3.0 | io.net architecture docs, grounded |
| Resource-integrity check | Proof-of-Work + Proof of Time-Lock (PoTL) | io.net support docs, grounded |
| Recurring verification | Daily Cluster Verification Job (standardized benchmark) | io.net support docs, grounded |
| Confidential compute | NVIDIA H200 hardware CC, Protected PCIe mode, SPDM 1.1 + TCG attestation | io.net docs, grounded |
| Trust model (compute delivery) | Verification-by-benchmark + continuous monitoring, not cryptographic proof of correct execution | io.net docs, grounded — note this is weaker than the ZK/proof-based verification used by systems like EZKL or Gensyn |
| Maturity | Live production marketplace, actively marketed/benchmarked | io.net site, grounded |

## Known limitations

- The resource-verification layer (PoW/PoTL/benchmarking) checks that a
  GPU exists and stays dedicated, not that any specific computation on
  it was executed correctly — a materially weaker guarantee than
  proof-based verification (contrast with Gensyn's RepOps+bisection or
  EZKL's ZK proofs). Worth keeping this distinction visible if io.net is
  ever compared against those systems on the same axis.
- No academic citation lineage found for the decentralization/trust
  mechanisms specifically — only for the underlying Ray-based
  orchestration layer, which is a general-purpose distributed-computing
  technology, not AI- or crypto-specific.
- This entry did not independently verify PoW/PoTL implementation
  details beyond what io.net's own support docs describe at a
  conceptual level.
